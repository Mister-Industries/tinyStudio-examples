# Basic Connection Code

The flow: set station mode → call `WiFi.begin()` with your credentials → wait for `WL_CONNECTED` → get your IP with `WiFi.localIP()`. That IP is what you type into a browser to reach a web server running on the tinyCore.

**Never hardcode your WiFi password in code you push to GitHub.** Create a separate `secrets.h` file with your credentials and add it to `.gitignore`. For a more robust solution, the `WiFiManager` library lets you configure credentials via a phone browser — the tinyCore creates a temporary setup network, you enter your WiFi info, and it's saved to flash.
