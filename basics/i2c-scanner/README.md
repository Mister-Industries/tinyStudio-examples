# The I2C Scanner: Your Best Debugging Tool

An I2C scanner is a short program that checks every possible address (1–127) and reports which ones respond. It's the **first thing you should run** when a sensor isn't working. If the scanner doesn't find your device, you know the problem is physical (wiring, power, bad connection) and not in your application code.

Running this on a tinyCore with nothing plugged into the QWIIC ports should still return **`0x6A`** — that's the onboard IMU. If you don't see it, check that you've set GPIO 6 HIGH and called `Wire.begin(3, 4)`.
