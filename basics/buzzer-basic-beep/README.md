# Basic beeping code

Let's start with a simple beep to make sure everything works:

Upload this code and you should hear regular beeping! 🎵

    Here's a fun fact: The classic Arduino `tone()` function doesn't work on ESP32! But don't worry - the ESP32's PWM system is actually way more powerful and flexible than the old `tone()` function.

## Open it

- **tinyStudio (web)** — [open this project](https://app.tinystudio.cc/Mister-Industries/tinyStudio-examples/basics/buzzer-basic-beep)
- **tinyStudio (desktop)** — Examples tab → *Basic beeping code*
- **Arduino IDE** — open `buzzer-basic-beep/buzzer-basic-beep.ino`

## Where this came from

From the tinyDocs page [How to Control a Buzzer (Analog Output)](https://tinydocs.cc/2_tiny-core/basics/buzz-buzzer/).

Section: *Step 2: Basic beeping code*

> This sketch was one-shot by Claude Sonnet 4.0 and checked by hand.
