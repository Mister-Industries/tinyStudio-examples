# On the tinyCore

ESP-NOW is built into the ESP32-S3 — no libraries to install, no extra hardware. The tinyCore's existing [Link two tinyCores](/2_tiny-core/basics/link-tiny-cores/) tutorial walks through the full setup with code, including finding your MAC addresses and establishing two-way communication.

The key code steps:

**Finding your MAC address:** Check the sticker on your tinyCore kit box — your MAC address should be printed there. If you can't find it, upload a sketch with `WiFi.macAddress()` and check the Serial Monitor.

## Open it
